### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Georgi Mirazchiyski.

I work as a **Software Engineer**, enjoying all things C++, with enthusiasm in graphics & compute, and a tiny portion of compilers/llvm.

#### Contributions

*WIP - this is an incomplete list of **open-source** contributions*

* **[ComputeCpp-SDK/samples/monte-carlo-pi](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/computecpp-sdk/blob/master/samples/monte-carlo-pi.cpp)** - Monte-Carlo Pi approximation algorithm in SYCL using Codeplay's ComputeCpp *SYCL 1.2.1* implementation; demonstrating how to efficiently utilise device local memory, as well as querying the maximum number of work-items in a work-group to check if a kernel can be executed with the initially desired work-group size.

* **[Making BabelStream's SYCL code compliant](https://github.com/UoB-HPC/BabelStream/pull/58)** - BabelStream is a benchmarking suite to measure memory transfer rates to/from global device memory on GPUs, developed and maintained by the HPC department of University of Bristol.

* **[triSYCL/path_tracer](https://github.com/triSYCL/path_tracer)** - This is an experimental path tracer using C++20 and SYCL for acceleration on devices like FPGA or GPU by using a direct implementation, using Xilinx' [triSYCL](https://github.com/triSYCL/triSYCL) *SYCL 2020* implementation.
    *  [GeorgeWeb/sycl-rayt](https://github.com/GeorgeWeb/sycl-rayt) - Example SYCL ray-tracing acceleration related to the below blogs:
